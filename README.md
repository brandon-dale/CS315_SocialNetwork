# CS315_SocialNetwork
Social Network Project for CS 315 at Sonoma State University.

The program reads in data about users in a social network as provided by a "JSON" files (see note at bottom),
and determines how users relate to each other, then creates basic HTML files for each users home page on the 
social network.

To use the program, simply compile it with the provided makefile, and run the program by specifying the input file to use.
Example:
```
./project1 <input_filename>
```

NOTE:
* Not any kind of JSON file can be used as input. While the style of input file for this project does follow the
JSON file style, arbitrary JSON files cannot be used. Examples of acceptable test files can be found in the "test_files" folder.
I have a much larger test case for those that are interested in it. However, due to its size, it cannot be uploaded on this platform.
If you would like to access it, please send me an email and I will send it to you as soon as possible.
